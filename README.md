A modern, responsive portfolio template featuring sleek design and smooth animations. View the live demo at [personal-portfolio-two-eight.vercel.app](https://personal-portfolio-two-eight.vercel.app).

## Features

- Clean, minimalist design
- Two responsive layouts:
- Centered menu-card style for desktop, focusing visitors' attention to individual section rather than the collated one
- Calendar/stacked-card design with swipe navigation, optimizing mobile viewing by displaying content as full-screen cards instead of traditional scrolling layout
- Smooth animations powered by Motion (Framer Motion)
- Easy customization through templates
- Fully responsive design
- Dark Mode (Can you figure where to toggle it?)

## Stack

- TailwindCSS
- Motion (Framer Motion)
